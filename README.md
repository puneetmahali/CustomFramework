# CustomFramework

### What is a framework and why do we use them?
A framework is a modular and reusable set of code that is used as the building blocks of higher-level pieces of software.

The best reason to use frameworks is that they can be built once and be reused an infinite number of times!

Creating frameworks is a relatively easy task, and using them can be just as easy as let greenColor = UIColor.black. Let’s dive into making custom Cocoa Touch Frameworks!

### Creating Frameworks
Steps to create the Custom Framework - SDK in Swift & Xcode.

1. Let’s open Xcode and create a new project. Select the iOS tab, scroll down to Framework & Library and choose Framework.

2. After creating a framework project then adding a swift file into the project and adding some fun stuff over there.
3. Import the SDK into the single view app project and call the SDK functions and that's it.
